Overall you had a good rhythm and structure to the interview. You asked the right questions. 
Some general advice would be to make sure you understand the technologies you chose for your design and aren't just using the latest buzzword. 
They'll be looking for how you make design decisions, how robust the design is, and whether the design fulfills the requirements. 
They will also be interested in how you take design suggestions into account. In the best cases, we hope the interviewer can learn something from you.

In general, your interviewer will care about: Trade-Offs, Communication, Logical Reasoning, Technical Curiosity, and Execution.
